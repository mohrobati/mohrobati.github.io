                    <p>
                        Not considering whether I was that wise man or not, I love Javascript and everything about it. I
                        have more than 4 years of experience as a Full-Stack Javascript developer. MERN stack is my
                        primary choice for development, though I'm willing to compromise on the M and E parts.

                        I've acquired knowledge in almost all the sections of a business' software stack. Whether it's
                        infrastructure design, determining the most efficient cloud solution, DevOps and organizational
                        operations, spinning up web servers and implementing business logic in the back-end, front-end

                        This broad knowledge makes me a versatile team player. I'd characterize myself as a big team
                        player as well as a team leader. I've had the chance to lead small to medium-sized teams, and
                        test out different team management schemes. I truly believe that "Teamwork makes the dream
                        work". Teamwork should not be overlooked. Choosing the correct team management scheme can
                        enormously save everyone's time and help the business grow more efficiently.

                            <p>Abstract— WebAssembly, or Wasm, is a low-level binary language that enables execution of near-native-performance 
                                code in web browsers. Wasm has proven to be useful in applications including gaming, audio and video processing,
                                and cloud computing, providing a high-performance, low-overhead alternative to JavaScript in web development. 
                                The fast and widespread adoption of WebAssembly by all major browsers has created an opportunity for analysis 
                                tools that support this new technology. In this study, we performed an empirical analysis on the root-to-leaf 
                                paths of the abstract syntax trees in the WebAssembly Text format of a large dataset of WebAssembly binary files
                                compiled from source packages in the Ubuntu 18.04 repositories. After refining the collected paths, we discovered
                                that only 3,352 unique paths appeared across all of these binary files. With this insight, we propose two novel
                                code representations for WebAssembly binaries. These novel representations serve not only to generate fixed-size
                                code embeddings but also to supply additional information to sequence-to-sequence models. Ultimately, our approach
                                seeks to help program analysis models uncover new properties from Wasm binaries, expanding our understanding of 
                                their potential. We evaluated our new code representation on two applications: (i) method name prediction and 
                                (ii) recovering precise return types. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our novel technique over previous
                                methods. More specifically, our new method resulted in 5.36% (11.31%) improvement in Top-1 (Top-5) accuracy in 
                                method name prediction and 8.02% (7.92%) improvement in recovering precise return types, compared to the previous
                                state-of-the-art technique, SnowWhite.</p>

                            <p>Abstract— Rust is a relatively new programming language which allows programmers to write
                                programs that have low-level control over resources while still ensuring high-level
                                safety guarantees (for programs written in safe Rust). Rust's ownership framework
                                enables programs to meet these two seemingly-contradictory goals. The Rust compiler's
                                Borrow-Checker component enforces the ownership framework requirements that ensure
                                Rust's safety guarantees. Rust is popular: as of 2022, it has ranked first, for the seventh consecutive year, in
                                Stack Overflow's annual Developer Survey as the most-loved programming language. The
                                number of Rust developers is growing as the need for faster and safer software
                                increases. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, no research has sought to identify the most pervasive
                                bug fix patterns within Rust programs. In this project, we introduce Ruxanne, a tool for
                                analyzing and extracting fix patterns in Rust. Ruxanne implements a novel embedding of
                                Rust code into fixed-sized vectors. Using Ruxanne, we mined the top 18 most-starred Rust
                                projects in Github to discover the most common bug fix patterns committed to their
                                repositories. We analyzed 87,726 code changes drawn from 57,214 commits across these 18
                                projects. After clustering the code changes, and conducting a manual analysis, we
                                discovered 20 groups of cross-project bug fix patterns, which we categorize as (1)
                                general patterns and (2) borrow-checker-related patterns. We describe each of these
                                patterns and their implications to automated program repair.</p>

                            <p>Abstract— A Program Synthesis tool automates the writing of computer programs based on a
                                set of specifications and constraints provided to the tool. In this paper, we outline
                                the development of a Boolean expression synthesis tool based upon the JS-Buxter tool
                                developed by author Mohammad Robati Shirzad. This automated program repair tool was
                                developed for resolving JavaScript bugs. It included support for the IF-CC bug fix
                                pattern, which focused on bugs related to if-condition statements. The JS-Buxter tool
                                used a “Brute-Force” approach, but it was clear that there could be a way to resolve
                                such bugs more efficiently. Since if-condition statements are activated based on a
                                Boolean result of some given variable(s), a Boolean expression synthesis tool would be
                                helpful in improving performance for the IF-CC bug fix pattern. This project is focused
                                on our development of such a Boolean expression synthesis tool. We provide background
                                information for the software and theoretical concepts we used in development of our
                                Boolean Expression Synthesis tool. These concepts are (in part) based upon the
                                Counterexample Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) approach. We developed two approaches
                                for program synthesis: “Feedback Only”, and “Feedback + Initial Probing”. We sought to
                                establish that these approaches achieved Boolean program synthesis much faster than a
                                “Brute-Force” Approach. All three approaches would take a set of variables and a set of
                                constraints as input. We collected data for all three approaches, for different levels
                                of expression depth. We analyzed the results of this data, and determined that these
                                feedback-based approaches achieved Boolean expression synthesis significantly faster
                                (more than 10 times faster for large inputs) than the “Brute-Force” approach.</p>
